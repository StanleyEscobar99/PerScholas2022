    <h1>Stanley Escobar</h1>
    <p>When I was a kid, I loved watching cartoons, I loved Spongebob, Ed, Edd & Eddy, Billy & Mandy, and tons more I
        still watch cartoons now. Now I watch them with my son, he just turned 4. I can't wait maybe one day he'll want
        to watch the same ones I grew up on.</p>
